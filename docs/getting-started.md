## Installing the browser plugin

### Google Chrome

The Unified CRM extension was initially architected for Google Chrome, and is therefore installed easily from the [Google Chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ringcentral-crm-extension/kkhkjhafgdlihndcbnebljipgkandkhh). Click the "Add to Chrome" button to install the extension instantly. Then, consult the instructions specific to your CRM.

### Microsoft Edge

Microsoft Edge supports most Chrome extensions. To install them, however, you will need to [make configuration changes](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/add-turn-off-or-remove-extensions-in-microsoft-edge-9c0ec68c-2fbc-2f2c-9ff0-bdc76f46b026) to Edge. In summary:
