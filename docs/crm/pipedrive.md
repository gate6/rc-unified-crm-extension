# Setting up App Connect for Pipedrive

The result is an easy-to-use, effective sales tool that centralizes your data, helping you visualize your entire sales process and win more deals.

RingCentral's integration with Pipedrive helps streamline communications between customers, and helps sales staff to better support them through their entire lifecycle by helping to manage and store communication history with customers, capture important communication metadata and more.

## Install the extension

If you have not already done so, begin by [installing App Connect](../getting-started.md) from the Chrome web store.

3. On the authorization screen, scroll to the bottom and click "Allow and Install." App Connect should automatically come to the foreground and show that you are now connected to Pipedrive. 

When you login successfully, the Chrome extension will automatically update to show you are connected to Pipedrive. If you are connected, the button next to Pipedrive will say, "logout".

And with that, you will be connected to Pipedrive and ready to begin using the integration. 

## Tailoring your configuration

Pipedrive's system exhibits a relatively uncommon behavior that is the result of a perfectly normal function of the frameworks used by their engineers. However, this behavior is unfortunate because it causes the dialer to be removed from the page after it has loaded. You may see it appear briefly, and then POOF! It is gone. 

To address this, go our [advanced settings](../users/settings.md#advanced-configuration-options) and set the config option called "Click-to-dial inject delay" to `2` or `3`. Depending upon network latencies, you may need to increase this number, but usually a value of `2` is sufficient.
