# CRMs supported by the Unified CRM extension

RingCentral's Unified CRM extension for RingEX provides support for a number of different CRMs including the list below. It is also a [developer framework](../developers/index.md) that allows companies to quickly and easily build integrations with more niche or proprietary CRMs at a fraction of the cost.
