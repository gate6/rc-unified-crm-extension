# Presence and status

Using the embedded phone provided by App Connect one can easily set their presence and/or status and instantly have that synced across the network. Similarly, your presence status will always be reflected in your embedded dialer as it changes via mechanisms outside of the extension. 

There are two ways to change your status:

* Click the presence indicator in the upper-left corner of the embedded dialer

     ![Change presence](../img/presence.png)

* Navigate to the Settings page under the more menu and modify it from there
