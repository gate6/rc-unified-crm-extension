# Prompts to log calls and messages

## Automatically prompt to capture call notes

Many end users would like confidence in knowing that every call they place or receive is logged properly in the CRM they are connected to. Furthermore, users also want to be prompted to capture notes about a call immediately upon a call ending. To automatically be prompted to enter and save notes relating to a call that has just ended, enable "Auto log call - only pop up log page" from the Settings page.
