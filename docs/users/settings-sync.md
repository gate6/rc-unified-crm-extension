# Synchronizing admin and user settings

App Connect enables seamless synchronization of user settings across multiple devices, ensuring a consistent experience between home and work computers. By integrating with administrator-managed settings, users can maintain their preferences while complying with organizational policies.

* **Cross-Device Synchronization**: Automatically syncs user preferences, themes, and configurations across authorized devices.
* **Administrator-Managed Settings**: Ensures that company policies and restrictions are maintained while allowing personal customizations.
* **Secure Cloud-Based Storage**: Stores settings securely in the cloud, enabling instant access when switching devices.
* **Customizable User Preferences**: Users can modify personal settings that do not conflict with organizational policies.

## Locked settings

Admins have the ability to set a configuration property and optionally lock it so that users cannot customize it. These settings have a lock icon next to them and cannot be modified.
