# Managing settings on behalf of others

Once you have access to the Admin tab, admins can manage the following:

* Call and SMS logging settings
* Contact and call-pop settings
* CRM-specific settings
* Advanced settings
* Set the custom CRM manifest URL

For each setting that can be managed by an admin, one can do the following:

* Mandate the setting be a specific value. This is done by disabling the user's ability to customize the value, and select the value you prefer. 
* Set the default value of a setting. This is done by setting the preferred value, and by enabling the user to customize the value. 

## What users within your account will see

When a setting is mandated by an admin, a lock icon will appear next to the setting and it will be disabled, thereby allowing the user to see the value, but be unable to change it.

## Managing CRM-specific settings

Each CRM supported by App Connect may expose custom settings. These settings can be managed under the area labeled as "Custom options."
