# Toggling the call-pop feature

The term "call-pop" refers to opening a page about an incoming caller automatically so that the person making (or receiving) the call can see all of the relevant information about that person prior to answering the phone. You can easily toggle this feature on and off under the "Contacts" section.

## Toggling the contact creation pop feature

Users can directly create placeholder contacts from within the extension to make call logging more efficient. Placeholder contacts would normally be created with just name and phone number. If users want to edit the placeholder contact further on its CRM webpage, "Open contact page after creating it" setting can be turned on to automatically open the contact page after the contact's creation.
