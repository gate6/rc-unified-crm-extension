# Configuring your organization to use a custom adapter

App Connect enables developers to build custom adapters to connect to proprietary CRMs, or CRMs not supported natively by App Connect. Users can load a custom adapter under "Developer Settings." Admins however can manage this setting across their entire account under the "Custom adapter" area of the Admin tab.
