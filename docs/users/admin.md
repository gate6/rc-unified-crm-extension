# Managing App Connect across your company

Super Admins within your RingCentral account have access to an additional area of App Connect in which they can manage the end user's experience across their entire account. This feature primarily allows admins to set certain preferences, or mandate certain preferences across their entire account. This allows admins for example to mandate that all calls across an account be logged. Or that specific settings be employed for their CRM.
