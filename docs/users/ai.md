## Logging AI artifacts in your CRM

    During the beta period of this feature, artifacts will be logged for free. When the feature becomes generally available, customers will need to purchase a RingSense license to continue logging AI artifacts. 

App Connect has the ability to log all AI-generated artifacts in your CRM, making sure your system of record has a complete record of the phone call.
