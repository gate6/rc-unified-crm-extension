# Setting your preferred device

RingCentral customers may sometimes have multiple devices or ways of initiating a phone call. To better control what device you use for placing calls, from the Settings screen select "Calling." Then, select the device you prefer to use. Options include the following:

## Config options

* **Browser**. Select this if you wish to place calls using App Connect itself. 
* **RingCentral App**. If you prefer to use the main RingCentral desktop app to make calls, select this. 
* **RingCentral Phone**. This option is not recommended as RingCentral Phone is no longer supported. However, if you still have this app installed and if you prefer to use it, select this. 
* **RingOut**. RingOut is helpful if you prefer to make a call from your desk phone. When RingOut is selected you will be called, and your desk/hard phone will ring. Answer the phone and we will then connect you to the person you are calling.
